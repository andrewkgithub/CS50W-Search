# CS50W Search Project

This project was created as part of Harvard's CS50 Web Programming course. It includes:

- A simple search engine front-end that mimics Google Search.
- Separate pages for Google Image Search and Advanced Search.
- Styling similar to Googleâ€™s aesthetics using HTML and CSS.

## Pages:

- `index.html`: Main search page.
- `image_search.html`: Google Image Search page.
- `advanced_search.html`: Google Advanced Search page.

## How to Run:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter a search term and click "Google Search" to see the results.

## Features:

- A fully functional front-end search form that redirects to Google search results.
- Links between the three search pages for easy navigation.
- "I'm Feeling Lucky" button that redirects to the first result.
